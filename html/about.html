			<h3><b>About Kolkata</b></h3>
			<p>Kolkata is my hometown. It's a big and congested city. Both rich and poor exists simultaneously here. Its rightly called the "<i>city of joy</i>" because all the people, irrespective of their caste or religion forget all their problems and unite to celebrate various festivals. It has the historic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victoria_Memorial_(India)" target="_blank" >victoria memorial</a>. India's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolkata_Metro" target="_blank">first underground metro</a> was also buit in this city.</p>
